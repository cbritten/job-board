Full stack job posting/viewing application


This is my first full stack application that I've published on this portfolio. This tool utilizes a PostgreSQL based AWS RDS instrance written in SQL, a Spring Boot API written in Java and utilizing Maven, and an Angular front end written in Typescript, HTML, and CSS. 

The API was tested using Postman and automated tests written in JS have been set up. The front-end was developed with a BDD and testing was automated using Protractor wrapped around a selenium webdriver
